The sat_eq_BYPASS.wav file is an audio file which has had the processing my plugin does BYPASSED

The sat_eq_ENABLED.wav file is an audio file which has had the processing my plugin does ENABLED

The Source directory contains all files I modified from the JUCE framework, and "UBHsat_eq copy/Builds/MacOSX/build/Debug/UBHsat_eq.vst3" is the vst3 plugin itself, which will work for any vst-accepting audio workstations if you drop it into the VST3 plugins folder on your computer
